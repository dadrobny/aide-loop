<!--
  AIDE insight inbox — the compound-engineering capture point. Copy this file
  VERBATIM (comment included, no slots to fill) to docs/aide/insights.md the
  first time an insight needs a home.

  Any role, at any time: when you learn something true but OUT OF SCOPE for
  your current task, append ONE line here and return to your task. Capturing
  is cheap and always allowed; ACTING on it out of scope is forbidden.

  Entry shape (checked by `aide check`, non-blocking):
    - [ ] <type> — <one line> *(item NNN, YYYY-MM-DD)*     (item ref optional)
  Types:
    knowledge  — true fact worth documenting (docs, CLAUDE.md, conventions)
    defect     — something is wrong and needs a fix item
    gap        — something is missing and needs planning (roadmap/queue)
    automation — a recurring manual/agent action that deterministic code
                 could replace (a CLI verb, a script)
    framework  — belongs to AIDE itself, not this project; triage hands it
                 over to the framework repo ([framework] repo in aide.toml)

  Triage routes each entry to its destination, then ticks it in place with a
  pointer:
    - [x] <type> — <one line> *(item NNN, YYYY-MM-DD)* → <where it landed>
  Triage happens at the queue boundary (feedback loop) for every type that
  lands in this project; a `framework` entry leaves for another repo's issue
  tracker and may be triaged on capture or on demand.

  The captured claim is IMMUTABLE — never reworded, reordered or deleted, not
  even when it turns out to be wrong (the wrongness is the record). Ticking the
  checkbox is the one in-place edit. Everything that happens to an entry AFTER
  triage goes in an appendable status trail: dated lines, indented under the
  entry, newest last.
    - [x] framework — <the original claim, never touched> *(2026-08-20)*
      - **2026-08-20** → aide-loop issue #50
      - **2026-10-11** → resolved in engine 1.16.0
