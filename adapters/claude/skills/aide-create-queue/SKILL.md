# Create Queue

Generate the next batch of prioritized work items — Step 4 of the AIDE loop,
repeated whenever the current queue is exhausted. The batch is **scoped to one
cohesive roadmap unit (a single stage, or a small phase), capped at
`loop.queue_cap` items from `aide.toml` (default ~10), whichever is smaller.**

## Prerequisites

- `docs/aide/vision.md`, `docs/aide/roadmap.md`, and `docs/aide/progress.md`
  must exist.

## Instructions

Read vision, roadmap, and progress, then write the queue from the template
**`.aide/templates/queue.md`**.

### Read the open insight inbox first

**The open inbox is an input to queue authoring, not only an output of triage**
(`.aide/conventions.md` §1 → `insights-maintenance-queue.md`). Read it with the
verb, never by opening the file — the file interleaves closed and open entries:

```
python .aide/scripts/aide.py insights list --open
```

Triage runs *at* the queue boundary, when the finished queue is closed and the
next one is unwritten, so a `defect`, `gap` or `automation` entry routed there
to "a candidate item" has been waiting for this run. Every open one is
**considered, and either queued or explicitly passed over — never silently
dropped**: an entry you queue becomes an item like any other and is ticked with
the item number it became (below), and one you pass over stays open — still a
candidate for the next queue — and is named, with why, at the end of your turn.

**Triage routes each unchecked entry by its type, and this table is the whole
rule** (§1 → `insights-triage.md`, where it is written once so that this skill
and `/aide-review-insights` cannot hold different copies of it):

| Type | Where it goes | Who ticks the entry |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge` | the owning document — the smallest edit that preserves the fact | the triaging role, on the fold |
| `defect` | a candidate item on the **maintenance queue** | the queue that absorbs it |
| `gap` | a candidate item — maintenance queue, or the stage queue when the stage was going to fill it anyway; or the roadmap's Backlog, by the owner, when it is scope not ready to plan | the queue that absorbs it; the owner, ticked `→ roadmap Backlog` |
| `automation` | a candidate item adding the script/CLI verb **and** the prose that mandates it | the queue that absorbs it |
| `framework` | an issue on `[framework] repo` from `aide.toml`; unset or offline, it stays pending | the filing role, on the hand-over |

Only the three middle rows are yours: a `knowledge` or `framework` entry still
open here was not triaged, so route it through `/aide-review-insights` rather
than folding or filing it mid-batch. The `gap` row's Backlog half is not
yours either: the owner moves a `gap` there, and a decline of any of the
three types is the owner's too (§1 → `insights-triage.md`).
**`defect` and `automation` entries never go to the Backlog.** **A
pass-over may carry a proposal for the owner, never a decision** — name the
decline, with its reason, or the Backlog move with the pass-over; tick
neither. A decline's reason names no item (§1 → `insights-triage.md`).
**An entry open across three or more queues is already the
owner's decision** (§1 → `insights-maintenance-queue.md`; `insights list
--open` prints each entry's wait): do not pass it over again. Queue it when
the owner has said to. **Until the owner has said, the author puts the
decision to the owner where the queue is reviewed** — in your closing
summary, which the queue PR body carries: queue it, decline it, or, for a
`gap`, move it to the roadmap's Backlog, with the one you would take and
why. Running with nobody watching does not change this; the queue's review
is where the owner answers.

**The roadmap's `# Backlog`, if it has one, is not a stage, and the queue
planner never queues from it** (§1 → `roadmap.md`): a bullet there reaches a
queue only once the owner has promoted it into a stage.

### Emit a maintenance queue first when there are fixes to batch

**When open `defect`, `gap` or `automation` entries exist at a queue boundary
they are batched into a maintenance queue, authored and merged before the stage
queue** (§1 → `insights-maintenance-queue.md`) — so one create call writes
**two** queue files:

1. `queue-NNN.md`, the **maintenance queue**, from those entries only.
2. `queue-(NNN+1).md`, the **stage queue**, from the roadmap as usual.

The maintenance queue is a normal queue in every respect — its own number, its
own items, ticking the entries it absorbs with the item numbers they became —
and it is not a second live queue: **the live queue is the lowest-numbered open
one**, so the maintenance queue is served first and the stage queue starts when
it empties. How the pair reaches a human is the caller's, below: push and PR are
never this step's. Number the items sequentially across both,
maintenance queue first, and wire every one of them into `progress.md`
(requirement 8) exactly as for a single queue — **a maintenance item's
deliverable bullet goes under the maintenance stage, never under the feature
stage whose module it touches** (§1 → `insights-maintenance-queue.md`; what
the stage is, §1 → `roadmap.md`).

**When a maintenance queue is warranted and the roadmap has no maintenance
stage, the queue's author hands back** — before writing either queue, since
the answer changes `roadmap.md`: name the entries that warrant a maintenance
queue, and say that **the owner adds the stage once, through the
create-roadmap entry point**. Nothing else triggers it: a boundary with no
entry that warrants a maintenance queue writes its stage queue as before.

Write only the stage queue when there is nothing to batch: no open `defect`,
`gap` or `automation` entry, or none that warrants a queue of its own. That
second judgement is yours — too small to be worth a branch, blocked on something
unbuilt, out of scope — and it is stated, never silent. A `gap` the upcoming
stage was going to fill anyway belongs in the stage queue, with that stage named
as the reason.

### Requirements

1. **Scope to one cohesive roadmap unit, capped at ~`loop.queue_cap` items**:
   - If the next stage's remaining items fit within the cap, queue **exactly that
     stage** and **stop at the stage boundary — even if that yields fewer items**.
     Do not pad from the following stage: a stage-sized queue keeps scope cohesive
     and makes the queue the checkpoint where one stage's lessons inform the next.
   - A small **phase** whose stages together fit within the cap may be queued
     whole.
   - A stage needing more than the cap spans multiple queues.
   - **A stage queue never takes the maintenance stage as its next stage**:
     it has no roadmap deliverable to queue, so pass over it. **The
     maintenance stage is the stage titled exactly `Maintenance`** (§1 →
     `roadmap.md`). **A stage appended after it is an ordinary stage**,
     queued in its turn.
   The cap is a **context budget, not a target**. Prioritise by roadmap order and
   unblocked dependencies; whether an earlier stage's icon meets a blocking
   dependency on it — a ⏸️ one included, or one withdrawn by a ❌ summary
   row — is §1 → `roadmap.md`'s to say.

   **"Run alongside" in a roadmap means independence, not concurrency.** One
   queue is live at a time, by design — the queue boundary is the human
   checkpoint. So a roadmap saying two stages "should run alongside" or "in
   parallel" is telling you they do **not** depend on each other's results, and
   may therefore be queued in either order or merged into one batch if they fit
   the cap. It is not asking for two live queues, and you cannot produce them.
   **Queue next, sequentially, and say nothing about it** — do not spend a
   paragraph explaining why you are not honouring an instruction that was never
   given. (Item-level independence *within* one queue is a different thing and
   works already: `aide claim` offers any unblocked item, so noting that two
   items may be picked up in any order is useful and correct.)
2. **No duplicates** — check existing `docs/aide/queue/queue-*.md` to avoid
   re-queuing completed or already-queued items.
3. **Sequential numbering** — item numbers are sequential across **all** queues;
   find the highest existing number and continue from it. Never restart.
4. **Testable, justified items** — each item must be testable locally, and
   each is queued for a reason the vision's posture row admits (§1 →
   vision.md; a vision carrying no posture line is read as `prototype`):
   under `prototype`, no preparatory or "for later" items: an item is queued
   only where a success criterion, a deliverable, or a justified sibling in
   the same queue needs it; under `durable`, foundations a later stage will
   use may be queued. A justified sibling is one the row admits, itself or
   through a sibling in turn, so a chain of dependencies of any length ends at
   a criterion, a deliverable or a foundation, never at an unjustified item.
   A candidate the row does
   not admit is not queued, and the pass-over is named in the summary
   (below), like an inbox entry passed over.
5. **A queue-end item is planned only when the engine reports a need for
   one** (§1 → `queue-NNN.md`). Stage validation is its only trigger today,
   so a queue that closes no roadmap stage never gets one. Once the queue is
   written and wired into `progress.md` (requirement 8), run:
   ```
   python .aide/scripts/aide.py check --queue NNN
   ```
   A `queue NNN closes stage N and needs a queue-end item: …` warning is the
   need, with its reasons. Act on it: append one final item,
   `Validate stage N: <stage title>`, wire it into that stage like any other,
   and describe it by the reasons the warning names — attest the stage
   criteria no item's AC annotates, replay the stage's use cases end-to-end
   (not just the unit suite), and flip the Environment-Gated Capability
   Verification rows the stage introduced to `✅ Verified` where the
   environment allows (`aide env --profile <name>`), else record in the row's
   Notes cell why it stays `❓ Unverified`. With no such warning, the queue
   ends with its last deliverable. **The planner reads that warning and never
   works the need out itself.** A warning that a queue-end item has nothing
   to do means it should not be in the plan. With no spec written yet, every
   unticked criterion counts as unannotated, so the item a closing queue is
   told it needs may later be reported idle once the specs exist; that is the
   check working, and dropping it then is the human's call at the plan gate.
6. **Consistent format** (parsed by `aide claim` / `aide check`):
   ```
   ### Item NNN: Short Title
   Brief description of the scope and deliverables for this item.
   ```
7. **No status field** — queue state (open/done) is **derived** from
   `progress.md` (a queue is open while any of its items is 📋/🚧, bar a 📋
   one of a withdrawn stage), and `aide claim` picks the lowest-numbered open
   queue by default. Do not write a
   `> **Status:** Live` line; the only decorative status note is the completion
   stamp `aide queue tidy` adds to superseded queues.
8. **Wire every item into `progress.md`** — this is where item numbers are born,
   so it is also where they must be recorded in the progress tracker. For each
   `### Item NNN` you add, ensure the number appears as an `*(Item NNN)*`
   reference on the matching **deliverable bullet** under that item's roadmap
   **stage section** in `docs/aide/progress.md`:
   - Append to an existing reference when a deliverable maps to several items
     (`… *(Items 006, NNN)*`); add the reference to the bullet that has none; or,
     if the item delivers something not yet listed, add a new
     `- 📋 <deliverable>. *(Item NNN)*` bullet under the right stage — for a
     maintenance queue's item, the maintenance stage, whose deliverables the
     roadmap never lists. A shared
     marker is shorthand, not a shared status cell: the first status change to
     any of its items splits the bullet into one per item, so the siblings keep
     📋 rather than being completed alongside.
   - **Never change a deliverable's status icon** — leave it 📋. This step only
     makes the item *trackable*; status transitions (📋→🚧→✅) are
     `aide progress set`'s job during execution.
   - **A batch that reopens a ✅ maintenance stage writes the stage's 🚧
     itself.** No verb moves the stage when you add a bullet, so `aide check`
     errors while its section header and Stage summary row still read ✅.
     **Write that icon into the two cells in the same commit as the bullets**
     — the value the rollup computes, not drift.
   - **Wire a marker onto a 📋 bullet only.** An item born on a ⏸️ or ❌
     bullet is settled from the start, so its queue would read done the
     moment it is written (§1 → `progress.md`). Queue a ⏸️ bullet only where
     its owner decided to resume it, and resume it first, by its place, the
     owner's decision and why it is queued now as the reason —
     `python .aide/scripts/aide.py progress set --stage N --deliverable K
     resumed --reason "…"` — then wire the marker onto the 📋 bullet it
     leaves and name the deferred work you queued, with why, in your summary.
     A ❌ bullet is not queued: the owner decided the stage does not need it.
   - Why: `aide progress set NNN` finds the bullet to flip by its `*(Item NNN)*`
     reference. An item with no reference is untracked, and `progress set` now
     hard-errors on it (engine ≥ 1.0.1) rather than silently no-op'ing — so a
     future stage's deliverables, authored (step 3) before this queue assigned
     numbers, must be back-filled here.

### Tidy the previous queue first

Mark the superseded queue NNN-1 completed with the CLI:

```
python .aide/scripts/aide.py queue tidy <NNN-1>
```

Write nothing else into that file: a queue entry carries no icon, and an
item's status lives in `progress.md` alone (§1 → `progress.md`). An item
carried to the next queue is deferred there with `aide progress set NNN
deferred --reason …`, and one its owner decided against is dropped with `aide
progress set NNN dropped --reason …`, so the why is on record either way —
never a ⏸️ or ❌ typed over the bullet. Skip if this is the first queue.

### Output

Save to `docs/aide/queue/queue-NNN.md` (next sequential number) — and, when this
run split off a maintenance queue, `queue-(NNN+1).md` for the stage batch
alongside it.

### Commit the queues immediately (do not leave them untracked)

A queue is a shared project document; `aide claim` reads the committed file.
Commit the new queue (or both), the `progress.md` item-reference back-fill
(requirement 8), and the tidy-up on the current branch, each a separate Bash
call:

```
git add docs/aide/queue/queue-NNN.md docs/aide/queue/queue-<NNN-1>.md docs/aide/progress.md
git commit -m "docs(aide): add work queue NNN"
```

**Wrote two queues? Stage both**, in that one command —
`docs/aide/queue/queue-NNN.md` *and* `docs/aide/queue/queue-<NNN+1>.md` — and
commit them together, titled `docs(aide): add work queues NNN-<NNN+1>`. One
commit, not two: `progress.md` carries the item references for both queues and
cannot be split between them, so a first commit staging only the maintenance
queue would reference items no committed queue declares. The pair lands in one
PR anyway.

**Push/PR is the caller's job, not this step's:**

- **Run standalone (manual)** — also `git pull --rebase` then `git push`,
  except in `local` mode (§4) or with no origin — `aide env`'s `origin` line
  then reads `not needed` or `none` — where the commit stays local.
- **Invoked as the `queue-planner` subagent inside `/aide-run-roadmap`** — commit
  only; the orchestrator pushes the `aide/queue-NNN` branch and opens its draft
  PR, which the built items later join. Say in your summary that you wrote two
  queues, so it knows there is a second batch behind the one it is about to
  open a PR for.

### Raise the plan gate when asked to

When the caller asks for the plan to be reviewed before it is built —
`/aide-run-roadmap` always does — raise the gate with the verb once the queue
commit above has landed, never by typing the row (§1 → human gates):

```
python .aide/scripts/aide.py queue gate NNN
```

Over a maintenance queue and its stage queue, one call:
`queue gate NNN --through <NNN+1>`. It reads `[loop] plan_review`, writes and
commits whichever gate that setting gives the plan — or none, and says so —
and prints each gate's ID for your summary. Run standalone and not asked, skip
it; a person can run it later, and a re-run never adds a second row.

### Tick every inbox entry you queued

The verb owns that edit and commits the file when git can; `N` is the entry
number `insights list --open` printed, or the entry's ID from the same listing.
The queue file and the specs name an entry by that ID (`insight <ID>`), never
by `N`, which the next archive renumbers:

```
python .aide/scripts/aide.py insights tick N --pointer "item NNN"
```

Never flip the checkbox or reword the line by hand: **the claim is immutable and
ticking the checkbox is the one in-place edit**. An entry passed over is left
exactly as it stands.

## Absorbed and passed-over entries

Close your turn by naming, in chat and in the queue-PR body if one is opened:

- the queues you wrote — the maintenance queue and the stage queue, or just the
  stage queue and why there was nothing to batch;
- the inbox entries each queue absorbed, with the item numbers they became;
- the ones you passed over, with why — **a pass-over leaves the entry open and
  is stated where the queue is reviewed**, rather than left for the next reader
  to re-derive. That is what makes leaving an entry unchecked an honest routing
  rather than a hope;
- the declines and Backlog moves you propose, each with its reason, for the
  owner to decide, and every entry open across three or more queues the
  owner has not yet decided, put to them as a decision — queue, decline, or
  for a `gap` the Backlog — with the one you would take.

       before the stage queue
     - a pass-over leaves the entry open and is stated where the queue is

     Requirement 1 quotes how the next stage is chosen around the

     Requirement 4 quotes the `queue-planner` row of the posture table, both
     cells, and the default — the same slice `queue-planner.md` pins, since
     the two deliver one rule to one operation.

     One statement, and it moved here in 1.46.0 (issue #109): "the live queue
     is the lowest-numbered open one" was stated in three sections at once,
     and queue state is what §1 → `queue-NNN.md` fixes, so that is where it
     is stated and the other two point at it. This skill still says it,
     because the maintenance-queue ordering is unreadable without it.
     Requirement 5 quotes the queue-end item's rule from the same section
     (issue #333), since the step it describes is this skill's to run.
     - the live queue is the lowest-numbered open one
     - A queue-end item is planned only when the engine reports a need for
       one
     - Stage validation is its only trigger today
     - with no such warning, the queue ends with its last deliverable
     - The planner reads that warning and never works the need out itself
